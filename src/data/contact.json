  "bio": "I'm a full stack developer with a background in education, ministry, and creative work so I build software that's not just functional, but thoughtful. My past life as a teacher and pastor taught me how to explain tough concepts, lead with empathy, and meet people where they are. Now I bring that same energy to designing clean user interfaces, writing solid backend logic, and collaborating like a human being. I thrive in projects that need both precision and soul, and I'm especially motivated by work that solves real-world problems without wasting anyone's time.",
